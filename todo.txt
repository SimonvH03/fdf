Colours
	(map read) interpret colours (or not, it kinda sucks)
	(colours) refine function for colouring earth

Over The Horizon
	(utils_fdf.c) info in comments

Map Iteration
	(map_iteraion.c) make a double while loop to iterate over all t_points in the maps and apply parameter function

Make
	(Makefile) write it myself

Problem:
map_iteraion takes a function to the logic that should be applied to every location [y][x] of the maps.
	as shown with fdf_draw, sometimes this means keeping the logic outside of the loop, and calling
		map_iteraion for the logic inside.
	in contrast fdf_colour is itself changed into a function to put into map_iteration
	this is a problem because all functions that have logic in- and outside the loop need to be split
		into two seperate fuctions, one remains in the adaptation and one gets called by map_iteraion
