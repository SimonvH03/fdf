Colours
	(map read) interpret colours (or not, it kinda sucks)
!	(colours) blend min, max depending on current
		for map first, then lines, must do both (unless very dense)

Menu
	(menu_draw) change menu text structure
	(fdf.h / fdf_init) change menu appearance

Make
	(Makefile) write it myself

Horizon
	(utils_fdf.c) pythagoras + move line point (or not, lotta work)
