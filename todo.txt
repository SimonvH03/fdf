Colours
	(map read) interpret colours (or not, it kinda sucks)
	(colours) refine function for colouring earth

Over The Horizon
	(utils_fdf.c) info in comments

Make
	(Makefile) write it myself

Cleanup
	fdf_draw: make constant by extracting the redraw check and redraw = false set

Make map palettes and shapes with new functions (see map_init), have to malloc.
