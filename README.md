Starting to work with structs really made me think about data organization in a new way.
Lots of trial helped me build a program in a way I could add new features with ease.
Noticing how similar a big group of my functions was, I attemped to combine all of them into one, which worked surprisingly well. (see graveyard.c to pay respects to the fallen functions)
